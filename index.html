		<h2>1. System description</h2>
		<ul>
			<h3>1.1 Basic Information about the System</h3>

			<p>
				The <strong>Car Rental Management System</strong> is comprehensive software designed to manage all aspects of a car rental business, integrating internal processes with customer interactions.
				The system covers <strong>vehicle reservations</strong>, <strong>rentals</strong>, <strong>returns</strong>, <strong>fleet maintenance</strong>, <strong>staff management</strong>,
				and real-time <strong>vehicle status monitoring</strong>. It also includes integrated <strong>billing</strong> and <strong>payment</strong> handling, enabling easy transaction management.
				With this integration, the system provides centralized access to information, enabling efficient operations.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<h3>1.2 Description of the Modeled Reality</h3>

			<li>
				<strong>Vehicle</strong>: Each vehicle in the fleet has attributes such as make, model, production year, license plate, vehicle type (e.g., SUV, sedan, hatchback), mileage,
				technical condition, and a unique identifier. Vehicles can be rented, reserved, or flagged for maintenance based on their condition.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Client</strong>: Each client profile includes personal details, rental history, reservations, billing information, and any restrictions based on prior rental behavior.</li>
			<li><strong>Employee</strong>: Employees of the car rental company are divided into roles such as Customer Service Representatives, Maintenance Technicians, Managers, and Administrators.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Shift and Schedule Management</strong>: Managers create shift schedules and assign specific responsibilities to employees.
				The system records shift start and end times, assigned tasks, and employee availability.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Billing and Payments</strong>: The system calculates rental costs based on vehicle type, rental duration, mileage, additional services, and taxes.
				Payment options include credit cards, debit cards, and electronic payments. Late fees, penalties, or discounts are automatically applied based on company policy and client rental history.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Operations</strong>: Core operations include vehicle reservation, rental, return, cancelation, maintenance scheduling, vehicle availability updates, and service record tracking.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<h3>1.3 User Types</h3>

			<li><strong>Clients</strong>: Can browse available vehicles, make reservations, rent vehicles, manage their rental history, and process payments.</li>
			<li><strong>Customer Service Representatives</strong>: Assist with client reservations, process rentals, handle returns, and manage payments. They can make reservations directly at the front desk for clients who arrive in person.</li>
			<li><strong>Maintenance Technicians</strong>: Track repair statuses, log service information, and update vehicle readiness.</li>
			<li><strong>Managers</strong>: Responsible for employee oversight, approving staffing decisions, managing shift schedules, and assigning tasks. They also handle escalated customer issues and approve specific client requests.</li>
			<li><strong>Administrators</strong>: Manage system configurations, user roles, and permissions. They monitor security, oversee data access, and handle account setups for new employees.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<h3>1.4 System Functionality</h3>

			<li>
				<strong>Vehicle Reservation</strong>: A client (or a Customer Service Representative on their behalf) selects a vehicle, chooses rental dates, and confirms the reservation.
				The system then marks the vehicle as reserved for the specified period.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Vehicle Rental</strong>: When the client arrives, the Customer Service Representative verifies their profile, confirms the reservation, and initiates the rental.
				The vehicle status is then updated as rented.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Vehicle Return</strong>: Upon completion, the vehicle is returned, and the status is updated to available. The representative logs any extra charges, fuel levels, and vehicle condition.</li>
			<li><strong>Reservation Cancelation</strong>: A client can cancel reservation before picking up the vehicle, extra charges will be added depending of time remaining to pick-up</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Billing and Payments</strong>: At the end of each rental, the system generates an invoice based on the rental agreement.
				Charges include base fees, taxes, and any additional costs, such as mileage overage or late fees. Clients can pay directly through the system or at the front desk.
				Payment status and history are updated in the client profile, and receipts are issued electronically.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Vehicle Maintenance</strong>: Maintenance Technicians update service records for each vehicle, flagging those under maintenance as unavailable.</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Shift and Schedule Management</strong>: Managers manage employee schedules, assigning specific shifts and tasks.
				The system logs shift start and end times, task completion, and employee availability. It also provides reports on staffing and usage, helping Managers to optimize resource allocation.
			</li>
			<li><strong>User Management and Role Assignment</strong>: Administrators assign roles, set permissions, and handle employee onboarding.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<h3>1.5 Non-Functional Requirements</h3>

			<li><strong>Performance</strong>: The system supports real-time bookings and fleet updates, even under high transaction volumes.</li>
			<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: The interface should be user-friendly, mobile-responsive, and tailored to each user role, allowing easy navigation to relevant functions.</li>
			<li><strong>Security and Access Control</strong>: Security protocols protect client data and restrict access based on user roles. System logs track all actions for accountability.</li>
		</ul>
